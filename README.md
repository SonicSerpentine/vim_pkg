### VIMRC ###

This is an evolving config based on my initial learnings of Vim, aesthetic preferences, and still brief experience developing withing it.  
One large objective of this config is to make it work across the multiple OSes and terminal environemtns I find myself working across.  
* Windows -> gvim or through ConEmu
* Linux
* OSX terminal

#### Univeral Settings ####

* synax on
* Tab indents with both tab key and > are set to 4 spaces
* syntax on
* numbers count up relative to the text cursor
* text search matches "/" are highlighted
* Consolas font
* backup, undo, and swap files are centralized in $HOME\vimfiles\history,  
rather than kept adjacent to the working files.

### Plugins ###

Purely aesthetic selections for now.  
* NERDTree
* Airline
  
Exploration continues...
* git interfacing (likely fugitive)
* some sort of linter
* WORKING es6 Javascript autocompletion
